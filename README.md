Assessment of Suitability of FOG Computing over Cloud Computing in the context of IoT

#Introduction
A rigorous and comparative analysis of the fog computing paradigm with the conventional cloud computing paradigm is performed.
The Analysis of suitability of Fog Computing is done in the context of the Internet of Things(IoT).
The Fog Computing Architecture and various parameters are used to determine the Suitability of fog computing in IoT 

To Model the fog computing paradigm by mathematically characterising the networking in terms ofâ€¦. 
power consumption
cost 
Service Latency
CO2 emission

#Objective
To evaluate the performance for an environment with high number of Internet Interconnected devices.(Terminal Nodes).
Finally to assess the suitability of FOG computing combined with the traditional cloud computing  in the context of IoT.


# Motivation
The Main reasons for moving towards FoG Computing  are-
- The rapid increase in the number of Internet Connected Devices
- The increased demand of real time applications
- Low latency services is proving to be challenging for the traditional cloud computing framework.
- There is also a demand  for cloud data centers(DCs) with irreplacable dependency on cloud computing.
- Data Centers(DCs) exhausts huge amount of power and yields tons of CO2 gas.

# Scope
- FOG Computing devices : Real time and latency sensitive applications with limited semi permanent  storage.
- Cloud Computing : The application requests that require historical data and large computational power 
- Suitability of FOG computing combined with the traditional cloud computing supports the ever increasing demands of latency hungry IoT based applications.
